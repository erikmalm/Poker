# Poker
 A game in java simulating poker games. Currently, only Five Card Draw is implemented.
 
 The class Deck is the primary engine of the game. From this class you can deal new cards and it keeps track of which cards that have been dealt previously. This should work regardless if the card is dealt to a player, a computer opponent or to the table (as in texas holdem), opening up for some interesting possibilities in the future.
 
 sorts an array of objects in class Card.
 
 You can currently play a simple game of Five Card Draw
